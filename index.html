  you look_
  <a href="page2.html">this is a link to your site</a>
  <h1>emmet write the tag you look?</h1>
  aaaaa
  <p>this is your first website haha</p>
  in html the main important is know about tags how to open and close and
  you will knowning all tags
  you have two ways to close a tag
  <h1>open and close tag</h1>
  and other tags like img are only 1
  <img src="this is a attribute when you will put the url of image" alt="alt texto to show when image no load">
  other important is ident in any language check all inside is 1 tab more right
  you can change the ident space here and will be 2 spaces but some people like spaces others tabs.. 
<h3>Very awesome</h3>
  that image dont load because that is not a url.. but show the alt text
  this is inside
  <h3>Hola</h3>
  this is one way to add style css to a attribute but is not the best way, is better abstract styles to external file 
  to be more reusable
<h3>Hello</h3>
  <h3 style='color: red'>Holaxd</h3>
  i duplicate lines with alt shift down arrow
  <h3 class='green-text'>Holaxd</h3>
  and now you can add that class to a lot of elements
  <p class='green-text'>xd</p>
